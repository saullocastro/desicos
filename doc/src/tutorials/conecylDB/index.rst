Cone / Cylinder DataBase (:mod:`desicos.conecylDB`)
===================================================

The :mod:`desicos.conecylDB` module includes all the information about cones
and cylinders required to reproduce structures that were investigated
by many publications and in the context of DESICOS.

It also includes the tools necessary to work with the Imperfection DataBase.
Unfortunately, the files composing this database cannot be available with
the repository, but all the tools required to post process an imperfection
file had been made available.
